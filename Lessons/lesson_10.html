                    <article><br>Nanotech is such a sci-fi movie thing. No ordinary person would give attention to that “nano-whatever”. But nanotech is a big hit in science. And everything awesome we enjoy now could be using nanotech in their mechanism.
                        <br><br>Take our smartphone for example. This is powered by a chip so it can function. Programs embedded to it are performed in the chip which is displayed in the screen which we enjoy. 
                        <div class="picture"><img src="./Resources/CPU.jpg" alt=""></div>
                        <br><br>Nanotechnology is like modification of the atomic or molecular structure. This is done to the advantage of the element. This is like GMO but in non-living things. Example of this is the plastic, a great pollutant. Plastics are synthetic and can’t be degraded. But with the help of nanotech, plastics now can be degraded. So, no pollutant anymore. 
	                    <br><br>The concept of nanotech begins on 1980s because of the invention of scanning tunneling microscope and the discovery of fullerene – the soccer ball like structure of carbon molecule. 
	                    <br><br>Nanotech uses ranges from medicine, gadgets, and even energy making. The more advance the technology, the more efficient it would be. This is the future of things. That is why this is one of the greatest tech humans has ever made.
                        <br><br><h1>Gene Therapy (STEM Cell)</h1><br>
	                    Gene therapy is a medical procedure that requires modification of person’s gene to cure or treat diseases. And because this requires human parts for procedure, both research and the application face a big ethical concern. STEM cell therapy is a type of intervention strategy that introduces new adult stem cells into damaged tissue to treat disease or injury. This can cure all kinds of diseases including HIV and cancer as per news says. Old organs can also be replenished using STEM cell.
                        <div class="picture"><img src="./Resources/stem_cell.jpg" alt=""></div>
                        So, for the impact of stem cell in the society, this can cause big distortion. Although everyone wants having a longer life, if death-birth rate can’t be regulated, overpopulation can occur. There will be more mouths to feed and fewer foods to be eaten. We can argue that life is important than food, but having no food can also take live of those vulnerable.
