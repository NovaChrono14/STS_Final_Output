                    <article><br>Everyone wants to be happy of course. And there are a lot of ways to be happy. But then people say that happiness is a choice, or is it? What if happiness is a state of mind which requires outside factors? What if happiness is only triggered? There are people who become happy if they satisfy themselves, others find happiness in satisfying others. Most of became happy for someone’s recovery, others find satisfaction in the pain of others(sadist), and other people find happiness if they are in pain(masochist). But the reporter on this topic defines things about happiness and gratifications based on technological influences. 
                        Take smartphones for example. I was very happy when I received my first-ever smartphone. That feeling is phenomenal, feels like I don’t want to drop my phone anymore. Months and years later, I still have smartphones but not as happy as I was when I first received my very first one. And deep inside I know that it is not the smartphone that makes me happy but what great things I can do with it.

                        In their topic, they have mentioned about reflection and meditation which is the real key to happiness. Finding inner peace is very important. As important as examining the impact of science and technology to humanity. They even mentioned that to be open to embrace the meaning behind our decisions and actions, we must be able to release ourselves from our calculative, technological, and scientific mind-set. This is tough if not interpreted well.

                        In conclusion, flourishing is just getting rid of things unnatural as a human being. It’s living on our means without the intervention of technology. It’s the gate that leads to true happiness of our beings. A person who can achieve this can be happy on his own. In a generation like this (Gen Z), only few can achieve this level of happiness.
