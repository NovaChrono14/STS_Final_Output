                    <article><br>Since the reporters on this topic show the same slides as the previous topic does, we really don’t get the heck out of the difference. But that doesn’t mean I can’t do my self-research on topics like this especially this type of topics really intrigues me. 
                        Well first things first, the meaning of life is different for every individual. Somebody wants material fulfillment and prepares for their future heirs while other just think about the present and don’t bother the future. There is no concrete purpose of life written by men except the Ecclesiasts. Maybe early philosophers do but they did not relate it to everyone because they know that each person has their own interests and goal they wanted to fulfill.

                        With the advancements of technology, especially in the 21st Century in social media, people are sharing videos about how people are wasting their time in their life or something. They are saying that we should not waste our time worrying about things. But the question is, how could they? It’s a default mind mode anyway.  But that is the dangerous part. Life advice on the internet is spreading like viruses. Other people might say that who are we to say that it is dangerous, there is a chance that a person might relate to it or something. But what if they don’t? Then they relate the advice to themselves negatively? That might cause more damage than good. 
	                    In terms of other development like gaming consoles. That is a great news. We can have fun even inside our homes. Well, that was great until gaming addiction came into place. There are reported cases of violence and crimes influenced by gaming. Medical concerns about children being brain dead after a week of non-stop gaming. That was lethal. Now, other people might say that it’s on the user and not on the unit. Maybe yes, but probably no. The way society works nowadays is that people pressure others to be like somebody else. That is why mediocre people always find ways to buy something they don’t need; with money they don’t have just to impress people they don’t like. But in the end, they are still not happy with what they have. 
	                    <br><br>So, talking about the purpose in life, how life can be happy is not the number of advancements they have in technology. Happiness to acquire something necessary for living is enough. But to struggle just for advancement we just want is way narcissistic over necessity. In the end, contentment induce satisfaction that will not ask for more and the purpose in life is defined by the satisfaction they wanted to achieve. Marcus Aurelius once said, “Remember the very little is needed to make a happy life.”
