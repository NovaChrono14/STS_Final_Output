                    <article><br>Progress: sounds overwhelming, isn’t it? It’s sometimes amazing how humanity came this far. From the moment humans are struggling to make fire, using stone tools, and now, we have internet. Not only that we have assistants both online and physical. Not just physical assistant, it’s a full metal buddy. A ROBOT! 
                        <br><br>But wait a second, how does this work? Well, for starters, robots are just walking computers. They are programmed for certain task to do. There are robots programmed for iterative works like slicing wood, filing papers, closing caps, canning foods, packing chips etc. Imagine world where everything is done by our robot buddies. No salary, 24 hours non-stop work, 99.9% accuracy in everything. What a wonderful production! 
                        <div class="picture"><img src="./Resources/robots on factory.jpg" alt=""></div>
                        Well, this is where the sketchy part goes. Everyone is looking for a good job so they can feed their family. I, as a college student who has family to feed, also strive to look for a job that won’t mismatch me. I’m an IT student who can program those robots. That’s fortunate for me because I’m a college student and I can use those credentials to find temporary work for now. But how about those less fortunate neighbors I have? Is it okey for them to just sit there and go jobless? If age of automation starts and a lot of people still don’t know how to make video and don’t know how to code, they will be jobless in the near future. The salary gap will just increase. So, enough for the sympathy for my poor neighbors and let’s say everyone is happy with monthly basic income to feed their families. Are we now good to go? 
	                    <br><br>Well, not really. If bugs on software like our social media apps are annoying, robots’ bug might be dangerous. That will cover from idleness, self-destruction, and worst of all, hurting humans. 
                        <br><br>Though there are laws in Robotics made by Isaac Asimov which bound robots to do only good things and not hurt humans, but that is too dangerous to play compromise. I still believe that we will not be replaced by robots because robots can only do iterative works. But if robots will be human like and will have citizenship like humans, that is utterly dangerous and creepy. Imagine if robots can learn to have emotions and judgements, and one robot turns into a “Karen” and slaps everyone who looks ridiculous on the streets, that is a big problem.
	                    <br><br>The question remains. Are we still needed in the future? Of course, we are! Robots cannot replace humans at all. Humans are better than robots though robots are more accurate than humans. We can appreciate how great a chef is. But a robot cannot. And even though they are awesome, their dominance is still debatable. Even nuclear power which is no doubt the best source of energy so far, still can’t dominate the market, with all the benefits 10 folds better than oil and coal. How much more robots which can only do repetitive jobs? We can’t get rid of them, but we can’t totally make them equal to us.
