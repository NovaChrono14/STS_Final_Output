                    <article><br>Since this is our report, I would like to take you to time. This page is just a historical timeline. Before internet and computers, thousands of years ago, people speak. They just talk and pass information by mouth. Most common information are teachings, stories, and songs. Then humans learn to draw way back 73,000 years ago. Then humans learn to write way back in the Mesopotamian times which is 5,500 years ago. Writing scrolls and notes rolls into generations. People used conventional papers in writing be it leather, papyrus (ancient paper) and stone tabs. Those are the good old days of Pre-Gutenberg era. 
                            <br><br>Then Middle age came. Writers are using quill and inks to write on papers. They mass produce it and so writers hire re-writers to mass produce their works or do it on their own. That was a tedious task. Until goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press. That was a relieved to everyone. He wants everyone to have information by hand. This era is the democratization of information when people is now in-reach of information. He even printed bible and a leaf of the bible that he prints can cost up to $80,000 which is equivalent to Php 4,000,000.00. 
                        <div class="picture">
                            <video controls>
                                <source src="./Resources/gutenberg.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                            </video>                         
                        </div>
                        <br><br>Now that people are still using printed materials and auctioning old significant printed materials for a high price. But information always asks for more. A wider and faster reach. Something like the internet we have today. It’s the end of the Gutenberg era. We are done with spinning and pressing just to print things out. We just click and type. Share it to the world. 
	                    <br><br>And in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the WWW. But that is only good for scientist in universities and institutes. And in 1993, it was officially open for public including the web editor. That is only read and write or Web 2.0. Web 3.0 is still to come.
	                    <br><br>Now, information is too accessible to anyone. Anyone can post or react. News is everywhere. And therefore, accessible information is also dangerous. As much as it is useful if its convenient to have, it’s also harmful in its state. Allied power won against the Axis power because Allied power upper hand in information collection. They even broke the enigma’s code and use it to their advantage. Now, no wars physically. But people are fighting online, spreading hate so fast since they don’t have real identities. Other people are giving fake advice and even medical advice which are not medically correct. And the worst part about it is that many people really believe in that. 
	                    <br><br>As a caution, we should be advocate of accuracy and peace on internet. I personally don’t join in nonsense arguments and conversation that can only lead to hate comments. I don’t usually share information about medical advice unless authenticity of the information is carefully checked with authorized people talking about a certain topic. Because in the end, the way I act on internet is what people would think I act in the real world. And what I was expected to be.
