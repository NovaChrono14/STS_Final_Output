                    <article><br>Philippines is home for a lot of beautiful sceneries and natural resources. But those natural resources alone aren’t enough. People should develop more innovative methods in making lives better. 
                        Since Philippines has been colonized by Spaniards and later took over by Americans, Filipinos don’t really bother doing crazy science and technologies on their own. And even during the Spanish Regime, there are not many Universities that offers Engineering. Fortunately, enough, there are schools that offers medical courses like the Santo Thomas University.
                        Americans on the other hand gave scholarships for higher education in science and engineering. Not only that, but universities also offer courses on agriculture, liberal arts, engineering, veterinary medicine, and even law. Recipients of scholarships are required to return to their provinces and serve there for as many years as his education was paid by the government, just like how the DOST scholars’ condition works.
                        Several government corporations were created and reorganized like the National Power Corporation, National Development Company, National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation and Bureau of Mines.
                        At the end of war, number of universities and college has been increasing. Agencies were also created including Philippine Investors Commission, Philippine Coconut Research Institute, Philippines Textile Research Institute, Forest Products Research and Industries Development Commission, Metal Industry Research and Development Center, and Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research.

                        On June 13, 1958, National Science and Development Board (NSDB) was established. It was reconstituted as the National Science and Technology Authority (NSTA) on 17 March 1981 with the vision of "A competent and competitive science and technology community with a social conscience." This was elevated to Cabinet level and becomes the DOST in response to increasing demands for S&T intervention in national development.

                        So far, the Philippines climbed to the 55th spot out of 82 economies tracked in the latest Technological Readiness Ranking published by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
	                    In conclusion, science and technology brought our country into a higher platform. Progress in science and technology will also increase the progress of countries economic growth. Food security, communication, lifestyle, and even climate change adaptation can be overcome if we can all be into science and technology.
