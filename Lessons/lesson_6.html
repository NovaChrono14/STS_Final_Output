                    <article><br>Like eating, sleeping and all other necessities, technology has contributed a big part in our day-to-day life. We wake up every morning and the first thing most people touch is technology. We prepare our meal and the thing that makes our meal is technology. We go to school, we go to work, almost everything we do has a print of technology. And if technology stains, we would be covered at the end of the day. 
                        <div class="picture"><img src="./Resources/Tech-Gadgets.jpg" alt=""></div>
                        The thing with technology is that it makes our life so easy and convenient and that is why most of us are really attached to it. Our psych tells us that we want to continue using it even subconsciously. This happens to me most of the time. The feeling that I don’t want to use my phone because I feel that it is nonsense, but then my hands keep on scrolling as if I care about the things I saw. And in the end, I don’t really recall a good thing I come across. This is the dilemma. In return of the convenience and accessibility, developers exploited it to their advantage: of course to earn more from their app. That is why Facebook is no longer block type but endless scroll. Videos and images come along so that we won’t stop using it. It feels good to see new things and it’s so convenient it just requires internet connection and swipe of a finger. 
                        <br><br>Facebook once face a court trial regarding data leaks, data hijacking etc. People believe that Facebook is selling people’s data to third-party companies to present ads which are believed to be once searched by a user or even talk about “in person”. This leads to conspiracies, leaks, and even scandals. Not only Facebook, Twitter also get a lot of complains about banning and account deactivations with no prior notice or significant reason. 
                        <br><br>This may be too focused on social media. Is that the only issue on technology? Well, not really. Take Ring Home Security camera for example. This was developed to make parents from work talk to their children as they arrived at home. Unfortunately, Ring Home Security camera is only locked using username and password, nothing more. That is why the device is so vulnerable to hacking and cause a big scandal to the whole America.

                        </div>  
                        This is not the only thing. Besides data breaching, data exploits, home camera hackings, nothing comes close to ATM bug exploits. From the past decade and as early as 2007 (though documents on hacking are hard to find), bank hacking is a thing. With billions of pesos stolen and recovered, a lot of banks are getting robbed online. Even machines sometimes release money more than asked by users. These incidents not only create great lost to customers’ money but also trust from the bank. Unfortunately, all banks already have records of security issues.  
                            <br><br>All issues aside, technology has a lot of contributions to our society and economical progress. Issues are issues and no one wants it. At the end of the day, we appreciate technologies based on what they can do and not how many times it would fail.
